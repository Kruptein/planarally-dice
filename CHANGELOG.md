# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-11

-   [3d] throwDice returns thrown dieName to handle mixed rolls
-   [3d] Add ability to configure dice clear timeout
    -   Setting to a negative timeout disables automatic clearing
-   [3d] Add friction and restitution to dice
-   [System:Dx] Handle d100 rolls properly + support for either 0-99 or 1-100 mode
    -   d100 rolls with 3d dice will now automatically roll a d100 and a d10 and accumulate the results into 1 number, this brings it in line with the 2d behaviour

## [0.6.0] - 2024-08-10

This is a release that changes a lot to the API!
The next minor release will likely do even more changes, by moving this repo to a monorepo.
This will be done in order to offer a fully non-3D package as well as one with 3D features.

### Changed

-   Upgraded babylonjs from 4 to 7
    -   This also changes the physics engine from ammo to havok
-   Almost everything non-3d related has been rewritten
-   Separate parts of the code are now exported on specific exports in the package.json

## [0.5.0] - 2022-05-25

### Added

-   Multi dice throws.
    -   You can pass `resetAllDice: false` as an option to the various throw APIs to not reset previous dice
    -   Only dice with the same `key` will reset in this case
    -   You can pass a specific `key` or let the API generate a unique key

## [0.4.0] - 2022-04-07

### Added

-   `Parser.fromString` now also accepts a single Options object if the same options apply to all dice
-   `tresholds` option to DiceThrower constructor to override the default stop tresholds
-   Optional callback parameter to throwDice and parser functions to modify the die mesh
-   `freezeOnDecision` option to freeze the dice when the stop condition has been reached
-   `engineOptions` option to the DiceThrower constructor to alter the babylonjs Engine creation

### Changed

-   Removed option to pass `undefined` to `Parser` for diceThrower instance
-   Angular stop treshold lowered from 0.1 to 0.075
-   `DiceThrower.reset` made public

## [0.3.0] - 2021-07-24

### Changed

-   DiceThrower.load now takes an `ammo` parameter to pass an ammo instance
-   ammo.js dependency has been moved to a peer dependency and has to be installed separately
-   Improved tree-shakeability of babylonjs

## [0.2.0] - 2021-06-06

### Added
